                    <p>
                        Traditional woven textiles, through the woven motifs and quality of yarn, express the beliefs

and cultures of a particular society in addition to their decorative nature, color and beauty. 

However, their beauty is secondary to the value these societies place in fabric since they are 

not just woven to cover or keep a person clothed and warm. They can show the rank or 

standing of a person, bond families together, have religious signifcance or act a protection 

against the spirits. All societies around the world once shared this attribute but most of us 

have now lost it. In South East Asia in general and Lao in particular they are still lucky to 

attach an importance to weaving fabric that has lasted until today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Until very recently textiles in Lao were woven for the family’s personal use only. An intricate 

fabric in silk would have denoted a rich family since only they could aford the expensive 

yarn and the time to weave a complex piece. In the same way, the various styles and fabric 

motifs denote tribal origins from diferent areas. As people migrated, they brought their 

weaving skills and specifc designs with them. Even today, an expert

origin of a design and the name of the tribe that created the piece.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lao is a poor land-locked country that has only recently begun to develop and change.

Because of the past geo-political situation, the Lao people stuck more frmly to their weaving

traditions than countries such as Thailand, whose economic growth ofered their people 

other work opportunities rather than traditional employment. Today, many Lao families still 

augment their income by weaving on home looms and

markets or to a weaving cooperative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Globalization, extensive travel and the growing popularity of Lao as a travel destination 

means that many people are familiar with Lao textiles and have even purchased a scarf, 

traditional skirt or cushion cover from the country. Soie de Lune has also taken advantage of 

the beauty of Lao textiles, the skill of their weavers and the country’s rich patrimony of 

designs, to bring this very special fabric to the world of interior design.
